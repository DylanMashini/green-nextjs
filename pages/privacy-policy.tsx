					My Green Earth values its users' privacy. This Privacy
					Policy ("Policy") will help you understand how we collect
					and use personal information from those who visit our
					website or make use of our online facilities and services,
					and what we will and will not do with the information we
					collect. Our Policy has been designed to ensure those
					affiliated with My Green Earth are aware of our commitment
					and realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to
					exceed, most existing privacy standards. We reserve the
					right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If
					you want to make sure that you are up to date with the
					latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page.
					If at any point in time My Green Earth decides to make use
					of any personally identifiable information on file, in a
					manner vastly different from that which was stated when this
					information was initially collected, the user or users shall

					the option as to whether to permit the use of their
					information in this separate manner. This Policy applies to
					My Green Earth, and it governs any and all data collection
					and usage by us. Through the use of MyGreenEarth.org, you
					are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures

					companies that My Green Earth does not control, nor by
					individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a
					website that we mention or link to, be sure to review its
					privacy policy before providing the site with information.
					It is highly recommended and suggested that you review the
					privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to
					use or frequent to better understand the way in which
					websites garner, make use of and share the information
					collected.

				<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

					membership forms, and emails. It is the intent of this site
					to use personal information only for the purpose for which
					it was requested, and any additional uses specifically
					provided for on this Policy.

				<h3>Notice to European Union Users</h3>
				<p>
					My Green Earth's operations are located primarily in the
					United States. If you provide information to us, the
					information will be transferred out of the European Union
					(EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision
					on the EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016.
					This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in
					the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United
					States for commercial purposes. It allows the free transfer
					of data to companies that are certified in the US under the
					Privacy Shield.) By providing personal information to us,
					you are consenting to its storage and use as described in

				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>
					My Green Earth takes precautions to protect your
					information. When you submit sensitive information via the
					website, your information is protected both online and
					offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g.
					credit card information), that information is encrypted and
					transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by
					looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for
					"https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
				</p>
				<p>
					While we use encryption to protect sensitive information
					transmitted online, we also protect your information
					offline. Only employees who need the information to perform
					a specific job (for example, billing or customer service)
					are granted access to personally identifiable information.
					The computers and servers in which we store personally
					identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
					This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized
					access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal
					information under our control.
				</p>
				<p>
					The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for
					authentication and private communications to build users'
					trust and confidence in the internet and website use by
					providing simple and secure access and communication of
					credit card and personal information.
